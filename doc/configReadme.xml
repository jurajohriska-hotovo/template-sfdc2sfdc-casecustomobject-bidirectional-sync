		<section id="use_case">
As a Salesforce admin I want to have my Cases from orgA synchronized with Custom objects from Salesforce orgB.

This template serves as a foundation for setting an online bi-directional sync of Cases and Custom Objects between two 
Salesforce instances with ability to specify filtering criteria. 

The main behavior of this template is fetching data for changes (new or modified Cases/Custom objects) that have occurred in any of the Salesforce 
instances during a certain defined period of time. For those Cases/Custom objects, that were identified not present in the target instance, the integration triggers an upsert operation (update or create depending on the existence of the object in the target instance) taking the last modification of the object as the one that should be applied.

Additionally, there are two sub-flows which synchronize Accounts and Contacts if the Case in orgA or Case__c custom object 
in orgB in manner of one time integration.
If the Account or Contact field in Case object is specified and the Account or Contact does not exist in the other org, it will be created there for the first time.
The matching criteria for Account is field 'Account Name'. And matching criteria for Contact is field 'Email'.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish starting point to adapt the integration to any given requirements.

To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, 
that must be made for the template to run smoothly. 
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

In order to have your application up and running you just need to complete two simple steps:

 1. [Configure the application properties](#propertiestobeconfigured)
 2. Run it! ([on premise](#runonopremise) or [in Cloudhub](#runoncloudhub))

		</section>
		<section id="running_on_cloudhub">

In order to [create your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) 
you should to go to Deployment &gt; Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 

		</section>
		<section id="default_running_on_standalone">

Fill in all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.dev.properties] (./src/main/resources/mule.dev.properties) and run your app 
with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=dev`.

+ scheduler.frequency `10000`  
This are the milliseconds that will run between two different checks for updates in either Salesforce instance

+ scheduler.startDelay `15000`

+ watermark.default.expression `2018-02-25T11:00:00.000Z`  
This property is an important one, as it configures what should be the start point of the synchronization. If the use case includes synchronization of every 
case created from the begining of the times, you should use a date previous to any case creation (perhaphs `1900-01-01T08:00:00.000Z` is a good choice). 
If you want to synchronize the contacts created from now on, then you should use a default value according to that requirement (for example, 
if today is April 21st of 2018 and it's eleven o'clock in London, then you could use the following value `2018-04-21T11:00:00.000Z`).

### Some points to consider about configuration properties

Scheduler Frequency is expressed in milliseconds (different time units can be used) and the Watermark Default Expression defines the date to be used to query the first time the integration runs.

The date format accepted in Salesforce Query Language is either YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm or you can use Constants (Like YESTERDAY in the example). [More information about Dates in Salesforce.](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_dateformats.htm)

The query fields list must include both 'Email' and 'LastModifiedDate' fields, as those fields are embedded in the integration business logic

#### Structure of the Case object

To be able to match pair Case object in orgA with Case custom object in orgB we needed to extend Case object in orgA with the following field. 

+ ExtId__c `Text(50) External ID` external id which is referencing ID of Case\_\_c in orgB

Feel free to customize the name of this field, but keep in mind that you will need to update all occurrences in flows for this particular field reference.


#### Structure of the Case Custom object

In this particular template we named the Custom object `Case`, that is the API name of the Custom object in orgB is `Case__c`, so all osql queries, DataWeave conversions are issued to this particular object. 
Case\_\_c custom object inherits all required fields from Case in orgA together with Description\_\_c, Subject\_\_c text fields and
Contact\_\_c and Account\_\_c lookup fields.

+ Account__c `Lookup(Account)`
+ CaseId__c `Text(50) External ID` external id which is referencing ID of Case in orgA
+ Contact__c `Lookup(Contact)`
+ Description__c `Text(50)`
+ Origin__c `Text(50) Required`
+ Priority__c `Text(50) Required`
+ Status__c `Text(50) Required`
+ Subject__c `Text(50)`

This structure may be customized but keep in mind that you will then need to 

+ update query `fetch case__c objects from B` in `endpoints.xml` to fetch all extra fields
+ update DataWeave transformer `transform Case to Case__c`
+ update DataWeave transformer `transform Case__c to Case`

		<section id="api_calls">
		
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. 
Case/Case custom object template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + CasesToSync + 2  / CommitSize***

Where ***CasesToSync*** is the number of Cases to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***CommitSize*** is because by default, for each Upsert API Call, Cases are gathered in groups of a number defined by the Commit Size property. 
Also consider that these calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then at least 13 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 2).
